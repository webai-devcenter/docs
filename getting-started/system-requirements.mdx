## Device Compatibility
webAI prioritizes delivering a seamless experience across various Apple devices. The platform is designed to ensure compatibility and optimized performance, whether you're using a cutting-edge iPhone or a high-powered Mac. Level of capabilities and performance will vary across devices.

<Note>**Supported Devices:** Mac computers with Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5) are required.</Note> 

## Basic Requirements

<Warning>**Operating System:** macOS 15+ is required</Warning>

**Storage:** Available disk space for installation and AI models.

<Note>A SSD is recommended for better performance</Note>

### Network

- Internet connection for initial setup and model downloads
- Ongoing internet is optional after setup (webAI runs locally)
- Wi-Fi (802.11ac/ax) and Ethernet (1Gb/10Gb) for local network discovery and communication.
- IPv4 Protocols are required.
- P2P traffic must be allowed on the network for nodes to communicate.

### Hardware

- webAI products are currently exclusively supported on Apple devices featuring Apple Silicon M-series processors (e.g., M1, M2, M3, M4, M5).
- 256GB+ of Disk space recommended (larger AI models will require more disk space).
- 16GB+ of RAM recommended (larger AI models will require more memory).

<Warning>
On macOS, applications can only access a portion of system memory for GPU operations. macOS limits GPU usage to approximately 60% of available RAM, which may affect performance for memory-intensive workloads.
</Warning>

**Memory:** Sufficient RAM for the AI models you plan to use.

### Security Configuration

- **Exceptions:** To ensure proper functionality, endpoint security software must include exceptions for the following directories:

```
.webai
.cache
```

## Understanding AI Model Requirements
Different AI models have different resource needs. For most use cases that require training or inference on consumer hardware, we recommend using a 7B parameter model. This is the sweet spot between model performance and size for consumer devices.

### Model Selection Factors

- **Parameter Count:** Generally, larger models offer better performance but require more computing resources
- **Memory Requirements:** Each model requires a specific amount of RAM
- **Specialization:** Some models are optimized for specific tasks (code generation, instruction following)

## Choosing Models for Your Hardware
<Note>Recommended Model: 7B parameters</Note>

#### Smaller Models

- Good for basic conversational AI and simple tasks
- Run well on most supported devices
- Faster loading and response times

#### Medium Models

- Best balance of performance and hardware requirements
- Suitable for most professional use cases
- All LLM features in Navigator work well with these models

#### Larger Models

- Highest quality outputs and capabilities
- Require more powerful hardware
- Consider hardware capabilities before use

## System Definitions

### Application Layer

- **Navigator:** A graphical interface for creating interactive AI application workflows.
- **Companion:** A powerful chat interface for local and private LLM interaction.

## Network Considerations

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Known Network Issues">
**VPN Interference:** Active VPN clients, especially those that route all traffic, can interfere with local network discovery and P2P communication between webAI components.

**Corporate Networks:** Corporate firewalls that block P2P traffic can prevent the Network layer from functioning correctly. Some restrictive NAT types (Symmetric NAT) may prevent direct connections between nodes.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Solutions">
**For VPN Users:**

- Temporarily disable VPN during initial setup
- Consider VPN configuration that allows local traffic

**For Corporate Networks:**

- Contact IT department about firewall settings
- May require network configuration for webAI deployment
</Accordion>
