Organizations are a workspace that groups together users, deployments, clusters and resources within webAI. Organizations provide a structured environment for teams to collaborate on AI projects while maintaining proper access controls and resource management.

In this article we will discuss where Organizations are managed inside of Navigator along with the structures in place from this setting to begin collaborating with other team members.

## Permission Structure

When you download Navigator and create a webAI profile you are creating an Organization that is associated with that profile in which you will be the Administrator. If you are a Member within an organization, you do not have the permissions to add new users to that Organization.

Organizations have two main role types:

### Administrator:

A user role with elevated privileges within an organization. Organization administrators have the authority to manage users, control access permissions, configure organization settings, and oversee the overall administration of the organization's Navigator resources and projects.

### Member:

Users of your organization who have access to resources in Navigator and can create, modify, and deploy AI workflows utilizing your Clusters and create new Applications.

<Note>
Regardless of your role type, you will not be able to see the Projects or Canvases built by another user. The configuration of these flows in the Projects tab are stored locally to a machine.

See the [**Exporting and Importing a Canvas or Project**](/fundamentals/exporting-and-importing-canvas) guide to learn more on sharing Projects and Canvases.

## Inviting and Managing Members

As an Administrator you have the ability to manage Members within your Organization. Once a user accepts your invitation and becomes a Member of your Organization, this will allow them to view Deployments to your Organization as well as utilize the Clusters that are hosted from your Organization.

### Inviting New Users

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click Invite User(s)">
    Click `Invite User(s)` from your Organization settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Multiple Users">
    Within the pop up modal - you will have the ability to add multiple users at once:

</Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send Invitations">
    Once you click `Send` - an email will be sent to these invited users that will allow them to:
    - Accept the invite to become a Member of your Organization
    - Download Navigator
    - Gain Access to the Invite Code

<Frame>
  <img style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }} src="/images/organizations_images/image_4.png" alt="Invitation email" />

  <Step title="Accept Invite">
    An invited user can click the `Accept Invite` button in that email or copy the "Invite Code"
  </Step>

    If a user does not click the `Accept Invite` button - they can copy the "Invite Code" and alternatively accept this invite by clicking the `Add` button on their Organization settings tab.
  </Step>

    This will allow them to input that code, click `Add` and be added to your Organization:

### Removing Members

#### Administrator

As long as you are the Administrator of an Organization you will be able to remove any Members from your Organization. Within the Organization settings all Members will be listed under the "Members" section. Click the `Remove` button next to each Member's email you would like to remove from your Organization.

## Filtering By Organization
