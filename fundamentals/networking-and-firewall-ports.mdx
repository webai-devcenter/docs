This article provides an overview of how webAI handles networking and port configuration to ensure a performant and secure communication between services and applications.

<Note>
  **Homeport** in the following chart refers to the currently deployed homeport that WebAI manages. This document does not cover any homeport usage that is custom.
</Note>

<Note>
  **Destination Port** in the following chart is used as both source or destination, where inbound requests are bound to that port, and outbound requests use that port as destination port.

### Known Issues & Limitations

We believe in transparency and want to ensure our customers are aware of any known limitations in our platform. 

- **VPN Interference:** Active VPN clients, especially those that route all traffic, can interfere with local network discovery and P2P communication
- **NAT Traversal:** While we have robust NAT traversal capabilities, some restrictive NAT types (Symmetric NAT) may prevent direct P2P connections between nodes.
- **Firewall Restrictions:** Corporate firewalls that block P2P traffic can prevent the Network layer from functioning correctly.
