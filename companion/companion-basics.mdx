---

Companion is your local and private AI chat interface. It allows you to interact directly with models running on your device or within your organization's compute environment. This document will walk through the different settings and areas within your Companion application.

<Note>
**Companion** is webAI's private AI Chat interface that runs the models you build inside Navigator. All interactions are processed locally, ensuring your conversations remain private and secure.

### Getting Started with Companion

If this is your first time using Companion, you'll be prompted to go through a brief onboarding flow to create your account.

<Frame>
  <img style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }} src="/images/companion_basics_images/image_2.png" width="746" height="814" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-07 at 3.39.47 PM.png" />
</Frame>

#### Setting Up Your Companion Account

To set up your Companion account:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Companion application" />
  <Step title="Enter your email and password" />
  <Step title="Complete the onboarding steps to finish account creation" />
</Steps>

Once setup is complete, you'll be directed to the main Companion interface.

<Note>
You must use the same credentials as your Navigator account to ensure proper synchronization between applications. This allows models deployed in Navigator to automatically appear in Companion.
</Note>

### Companion Models

The left-hand panel in Companion displays all chat models available to you. This panel serves as your model library, showing every AI assistant you have access to through your local device or organizational deployments.

<Frame>
  <img style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }} src="/images/companion_basics_images/image_3.png" width="1192" height="858" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-07 at 3.47.21 PM.png" />
</Frame>

By default, Companion automatically selects the model that best fits your device's compute power. 

You can switch models at any time using the model dropdown menu.

</Frame>

#### Available Models

If this is your first time using Companion, you'll most likely only see the default local model. However:

- Any models you've deployed to Companion through Navigator will appear here
- If you're part of clusters or organizations that have deployed models, those will also be listed
- Custom LLM chatbots created from Featured Templates will be accessible
- Document QnA and RAG-based assistants you've configured will show up as separate models

<Note>
**Model Status Indicators:** Models that are active and ready for chat display a green icon. This indicates the model is fully loaded and ready to process your requests. Models that are loading or unavailable will show a grey offline status.

</Note>

For additional information on deploying models, see the [Deployments Overview](https://support.webai.com/hc/en-us/articles/45647521605779-Deployments-Overview) article.

### Interacting with Your Models

To chat with a model:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a model from the left-hand column" />
  <Step title="Type your question or prompt in the chat" />
  <Step title="Click the blue arrow to send your message" />
</Steps>

<Frame>
  <img style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }} src="/images/companion_basics_images/image_7.png" width="1510" height="162" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-07 at 4.02.43 PM.png" />
</Frame>

Your model will generate a response directly in the chat window. Responses appear in real-time as the model processes your input. 

### Starting a New Conversation

To start a new chat thread with the selected model:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click the Chat icon in the interface" />
  <Step title="A new blank chat will appear, keeping your previous conversations saved and organized" />
</Steps>

<Frame>
  <img style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }} src="/images/companion_basics_images/image_8.png" width="400" height="110" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-07 at 4.03.40 PM.png" />
</Frame>

<Note>
**Conversation Management:** Each model maintains its own conversation history, allowing you to have multiple ongoing conversations with different models. Your previous conversations are automatically saved and can be accessed at any time from the left panel. You can also search for a previous conversation by using the **Search** bar.
</Note>

### Chat Features

At the bottom of the chat, you'll see three icons that enhance your chat experience:

</Frame>

#### 1. Web Search Toggle

Enables your model to search the internet for additional information.

- Requires an active internet connection
- Useful for questions about recent events, current data, or real-time information
- Can be toggled on or off for each conversation

#### 2. Reasoning Mode

Displays the reasoning path or logic your model used to arrive at its response.

- Shows step-by-step thought process
- Helps understand how the model reached its conclusions
- Useful for debugging complex queries or verifying logic
- Provides transparency into the AI's decision-making

#### 3. Speech-to-Text

Converts spoken input into text, allowing you to chat hands-free.

- Click the microphone icon to activate
- Speak your question or prompt naturally
- Text appears in the chat as you speak
- Ideal for longer prompts or accessibility needs

### Generating Files

Companion can generate interactive, code-based files, such as HTML, Python, or JavaScript, directly within the application. This powerful feature allows you to create functional code, web pages, scripts, and more through natural conversation.

#### Creating a File

To generate a file:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Type a request describing what you'd like created (Example: 'Create a file with HTML text formatting options')" />
  <Step title="Companion will create the file and display it in the interface" />
  <Step title="You can interact with, edit, save, or share the generated file as needed" />
</Steps>

<Frame>
  <img style={{ borderRadius:"0.5rem" }} src="/images/companion_basics_images/image_10.png" width="1328" height="552" alt="Screenshot 2025-11-07 at 4.11.58 PM.png" />
</Frame>

<Note>
Your file will appear within the chat. **Your generated file will automatically be named after the conversation title, which is based on the first question or prompt you send to your model.**
</Note>

#### Working with Generated Files

Once a file is generated, you have several options:

- **Preview:** View the file directly in Companion's built-in viewer
- **Edit:** Request modifications or improvements through natural language
- **Save:** Export the file to your local system for use in other applications
- **Iterate:** Continue refining the file through follow-up prompts

#### Accessing Saved Files

All files created in Companion are automatically saved and can be accessed by clicking the Files icon in the top-right corner of the interface.

The Files panel provides:

- A complete history of all generated files
- Quick access to previously created content
- Options to re-open, edit, or share files
