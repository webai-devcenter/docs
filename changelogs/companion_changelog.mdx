We're excited to announce the release of Companion, webAI's private AI chat interface that allows you to interact directly with models running on your device or within your organization's compute environment. Companion is a standalone application that works seamlessly with Navigator, automatically displaying any models you've deployed from Navigator. With features like file generation, web search, reasoning mode, and speech-to-text, Companion provides a comprehensive and private AI chat experience. For detailed setup instructions and usage guides, see [Getting Started with Companion](/companion/companion).
