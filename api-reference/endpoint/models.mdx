## Usage

Make a GET request to retrieve the list of available models:

```

## Response Format

  "data": [
    {
      "created": 1747937728,
      "id": "webai/llm",
      "object": "model",
      "owned_by": "webai"
    }
  ],
  "object": "list"
}
```

## Response Fields

- **object** - Always "list" for this endpoint
- **data** - Array of model objects with the following fields:
  - **id** - The model identifier used in API requests
  - **object** - Always "model" for model objects
  - **created** - Unix timestamp of when the model was created
  - **owned_by** - The organization that owns the model

## Using Model IDs

Use the model `id` from this endpoint when making requests to other API endpoints:

```json

  "model": "webai/llm",
  "messages": [...]
}
```

## Model Capabilities

To check if a model supports specific features like multimodal inputs:
1. Navigate to the LLM Element Settings in Navigator
2. Look for the image icon next to model names
3. Models with the image icon support both text and image inputs

<Note>
  The available models depend on your Navigator configuration and the models you have set up in your LLM workflows.
