      Note: since this is likely your first time running a model on your device using Navigator, it may take a few minutes to download and become active.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Interact with Your Bot">
    Once the download is complete, your canvas will automatically switch to the **Preview** view, where you can begin interacting with your bot!

You have now successfully created your first local AI model on your device!

### Step 3 (Optional) - Adjusting your LLM Chatbot's Settings

Within the **Preview** view, where you can interact directly with your LLM Chatbot inside Navigator, you also have the option to fine-tune your flow's settings.

To make adjustments, click on the dropdown menu next to the **Active** button and select **Stop.**

### Quick Tips

- By default, the LLM Element uses Meta Llama 3.1 8B Instruct 4bit. You can adjust the model by clicking on the LLM Element and clicking on the Large Language Model Dropdown. **When selecting a different LLM, please make sure the models you select are suitable for the available memory on your device.**
- Models marked with the following symbol are **Gated** models, meaning you will need to enter your Hugging Face API Key.

  <Note>
    If you are using a gated model for the first time, you will need to make sure you have requested access to that model within Hugging Face and your request has been approved.
  </Note>
- For additional information on the LLM Element and the API Element's settings, you can visit our [Element Registry](/fundamentals/element-registry).
