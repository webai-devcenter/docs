## What is webAI?

webAI is a vertically integrated, local-first AI platform that simplifies the entire lifecycle of AI—from model creation to deployment. Instead of relying on cloud providers where you lose control of your data, webAI runs everything within your environment.

## The webAI Solution

webAI offers a third path: privacy, ownership, and scale through two powerful tools:

#### Navigator: Your AI Development Environment

Build AI applications using a visual workflow builder. Drag and drop elements to create everything from chatbots to document processing systems. Train custom models on your data, all running locally.

#### Companion: Your Private AI Assistant

Deploy your Navigator-built applications as a desktop chat interface. Have conversations with your custom AI models, completely private and secure on your device.

## Core Concepts
Understanding these concepts will help you get the most out of webAI:

### Local-First Architecture
Unlike cloud AI services, webAI runs entirely on your devices.

- No internet required for AI conversations (after initial setup)
- Complete data privacy - nothing leaves your environment
- Predictable performance - no network latency or service outages
- Full control over when and how your AI runs

### Visual Workflow Building
Navigator uses a drag-and-drop interface to build AI applications.

- Elements: Individual components like AI models, data processors, APIs
- Connections: Lines that show how data flows between elements
- Templates: Pre-built workflows you can customize
- Deployments: Running applications that users can interact with

### Clusters and Deployments
Your AI applications run on clusters of devices:

- Clusters: Groups of devices that can run your AI models
- Deployments: Running instances of your workflows
- Scaling: Add more devices to handle more users or larger models
- Management: Monitor and control your AI applications
