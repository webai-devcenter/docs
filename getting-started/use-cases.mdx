This comprehensive guide provides detailed use case examples and implementation strategies for AI solutions across various industries. Each example follows a structured approach: defining specific goals, starting with broad categories, and progressively refining your solution through iterative implementation and testing.

---

## Planning Your AI Solution

Once you've identified a use case, break it down into incremental steps:

- **Define specific goals** - What exact problem are you solving?
- **Start broad, then refine** - Begin with general categories before moving to specific details
- **Implement, test, and iterate** - Build your solution progressively

## Choosing the Right AI Architecture

Based on your use case and available data, select the appropriate AI architecture:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Large Language Model (LLM) Solutions">

- **Choose when:** Your data is primarily text-based (PDFs, Word documents, text files)
- **What it does:** Creates an AI subject matter expert you can chat with through text prompts
- **Key benefit:** Provides conversational access to knowledge in your documents
- **Best for:**
  - Document Q&A
  - Customer Support
  - Knowledge Management

</Tab>
  <Tab title="Computer Vision Solutions">

Computer vision solutions require image data (still images or video) and come in two main categories:

**Image Classifiers**

- **Choose when:** You need to categorize entire images
- **What it does:** Labels a complete image based on its content
- **Example:** A classifier trained to identify "Hot Dog" vs. "Not Hot Dog" will label the entire image based on whether it contains a hot dog
- **Best for:**
  - Quality Control
  - Medical Imaging
  - Product Classification

**Object Detectors**

- **Choose when:** You need to locate specific objects within images
- **What it does:** Finds objects within images, draws bounding boxes around them, and applies appropriate labels
- **Example:** An object detector trained on hot dogs will draw a bounding box around any hot dog in an image and label it specifically, rather than labeling the entire image
- **Best for:**
  - Security Monitoring
  - Inventory Management
  - Medical Analysis
