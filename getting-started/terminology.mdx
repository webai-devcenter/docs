    **Algorithm:** A set of rules or instructions that a computer follows to solve a problem or perform a task. In AI, algorithms are the foundation for how a model learns and makes decisions.

    **Dataset:** A collection of data that is used to train, test, and evaluate an AI model. The quality and size of the dataset are critical for a model's performance.

    **Neural Network:** A type of machine learning model inspired by the human brain. It's composed of interconnected nodes, or "neurons", organized in layers. These networks are used for tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.

    **LLM (Large Language Model):** A Large Language Model (LLM) is a powerful AI model trained on massive amounts of text data. LLMs are excellent for tasks involving natural language processing, as they can generate human-like and contextually relevant responses.

    **Object Detector:** A computer vision model that identifies and localizes specific objects within an image or video. It does this by drawing bounding boxes around each detected object.

    **Bounding Box:** A Bounding Box is a rectangular outline that visually highlights the precise location of an object in an image or video. They are a key feature of object detection models.

    **Classifier:** A classifier is an AI model that organizes input data into predefined categories or classes. It works by recognizing patterns and features within the data.

    **Model Confidence:** Model Confidence is a measure of how certain an AI model is about its prediction. A higher confidence score indicates the model is more sure of its result.

    **Model Accuracy:** Model Accuracy measures the performance of a model as a percentage of correct predictions out of all attempts. Higher accuracy means better performance.

    **Vision Model:** A type of AI model specifically designed to process and understand visual information, such as images or videos. Vision models can perform tasks like object detection, image classification, and scene understanding.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI Processes">
    **AI Model Training:** AI Model Training is the process of teaching an AI model to recognize patterns using large datasets. The model learns features and relationships to make accurate predictions or generate outputs.

    **AI Model Inference:** AI Model Inference is the process of using a trained model to make predictions or recognize patterns by feeding it with large, unseen datasets. The model learns from this data to deliver accurate predictions in real-time.

    **Computer Vision:** Computer Vision is a branch of AI focused on enabling machines to "see" and interpret visual data, like images and videos. It enables machines to interpret and extract meaningful insights from visual inputs.

    **Fine-tuning:** Fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained model to perform better on a specific task or dataset by continuing the training process with domain-specific data.

    **Quantization:** Quantization is a technique used to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of AI models by reducing the precision of their numerical parameters.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="RAG Ingestion Process">
    **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** A technique that improves the output of an LLM by allowing it to access and use information from external, authoritative data sources—like a company's internal documents—before generating a response. This process makes the model's answers more accurate, timely, and specific to a given context without having to retrain the entire model.

    **Vector Database:** A specialized type of database that stores embeddings (numerical representations of data) and is optimized for efficient searches based on the conceptual similarity of those vectors, rather than keywords. It's the central repository where the "meaning" of your documents is stored.

    **Chunking:** Chunking is part of the RAG Ingestion process where a document is broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces, or chunks, that can be searched and retrieved by the model.

    **Chunk Size:** The maximum size (in tokens or characters) for each chunk when breaking down documents. Smaller chunks provide better precision but may lose context, while larger chunks preserve context but may exceed model limits.

    **Chunk Overlap:** The overlapping size between chunks to preserve context across boundaries. This helps maintain semantic continuity when documents are split into smaller pieces.

    **Embedding:** Embedding is the process within the RAG Ingestion Process that converts chunks into "meaning" that the LLM can search and interact with.

    **Vector Retrieval:** The process of searching through a vector database to find the most relevant chunks based on semantic similarity to a user's query.

    **Top K:** Top K controls how many of the most relevant pieces of content webAI returns when you perform an embedding-based search. It determines the number of chunks retrieved from the vector database for use in generating responses.

    **Prompt Templating:** The process of formatting retrieved vector information into a structured prompt that can be used by language models to generate coherent responses.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Document Processing">
    **OCR (Optical Character Recognition):** OCR is a technology that converts images containing text into machine-readable text. It's the first step in processing documents for RAG systems, enabling the extraction of textual content from images and PDFs.

    **Vector Indexing:** The process of storing processed embeddings in a fast, searchable vector database (like ChromaDB) for efficient retrieval during inference.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Technical Implementation Terms

The following are advanced concepts related to model training, deployment, and system architecture.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Token and Text Processing">
