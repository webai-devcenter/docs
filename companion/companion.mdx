Companion is your private and personal AI chat that lives on your desktop. It connects you to the AI models and workflows you've built in Navigator, providing a simple chat interface for accessing your AI applications.

## What is Companion?

Companion is the chat interface where you interact with your AI models after building them in Navigator. It's designed to make using your custom AI as simple as having a conversation.

## Getting Companion Running

To run Companion and deploy flows to it, you'll need to install and set up Navigator first. Both applications are installed together through the webAI Installer.

### Setup Process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install both Navigator and Companion using the webAI Installer">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create your Navigator account and sign in">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch Companion and log in with the same credentials as your Navigator account">
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How Companion Works with Navigator

### Automatic Model Connection

When you deploy AI models in Navigator, they automatically become available in Companion without any additional setup.

### What Happens:

- **Build a workflow in Navigator**
- **Deploy it to your cluster**
- **The model appears automatically in Companion's interface**
- **Start chatting immediately**

### Model Status

Wait for the included LLM to install. This may take some time. Once the Status dot next to the Icon turns green, start chatting.

**Status Indicators:**

- Models show visual status indicators

- Green status means the model is ready to use

- Installation and loading may take time initially

## Using Companion

### Starting Conversations

Once your AI models are deployed and ready:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Companion">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Look for your deployed models">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for the green status indicator">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click on a model to start chatting">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Type your message and begin the conversation">
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Managing Multiple Models

Companion can handle multiple AI models simultaneously:

- Each deployed model appears as a separate option

- You can have different conversations with different models

- Switch between models for different types of assistance

### Conversation Features

**Attachments:** Attachments are created automatically by Companion when your AI models generate files or structured content.

**Attachment Handling:**

- Click the attachment to open it in the attachment panel

- Flip between attachments using the back arrow on the panel

- Attachments help organize AI-generated content

**App Intents:** Trigger actions with other native Mac apps with a command in Companion.

**Supported App Intents:**

- Send an email using the Mail App

- Create Calendar Event in the Calendar app

- Search the web - Search button in the prompt bar must be selected

**New Conversations:** New threads can also be created using the left panel, allowing you to start fresh conversations or organize different topics.

## What You Can Chat With

Based on what you can build in Navigator, Companion connects you to various types of AI:

### Template-Based Models

**LLM Chatbot:** The basic conversational AI assistant from Navigator's featured templates.

**Document QnA:** AI systems that can answer questions about documents you've uploaded and processed.

### Custom AI Applications

**Specialized Assistants:** AI models you've customized or trained for specific purposes in Navigator.

**Custom Workflows:** More complex AI applications built using Navigator's visual workflow system.

## Technical Setup

### Account Integration

Companion uses the same account credentials as Navigator, ensuring seamless integration between building AI applications and using them.

### Local Operation

Companion operates locally on your desktop, connecting to AI models running on your device or cluster without requiring external cloud services.

## Common Setup Issues

### Connection Problems

**Models Not Appearing:**

- Verify that models are properly deployed in Navigator

- Ensure both Navigator and Companion are signed in with the same account

- Check that your cluster is active and running

**Can't Start Conversations:**

- Wait for model status indicators to show ready (typically green)

- Ensure sufficient system resources for the AI models

- Restart Companion if connection issues persist

### Performance Considerations

**Model Loading:**

- First-time model loading may take several minutes

- Larger models require more time to become active

- System performance affects model responsiveness
